## 1. Read Data In
`Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.`


## 2. Manipulate and Clean Your Data
`Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong in your dataset.`


skiprows - I used skiprows when reading the datasets in to skip over the title so the dataframe will start at the column headings. 

## 3. Analyze Your Data
`Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out something about your data.`

`Do 5 basic calculations with Pandas`

## 4. Visualize Your Data
`Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.`
